Any sequence of characters is a valid CommonMark document.

A line is a sequence of 0 or more characters other than line feed 
or carriage return, followed by a line ending or be the end of file

A line ending is a line feed, a carriage return not followed by a 
line feed, or a carriage return and a following line feed

A line containing no characters, or a line containing only spaces 
or tab, is a blank line.

Character definitions

A Unicode whitespace character is a character in the Unicode 
general category, or a tab, line feed, form feed, or carriage 
return.

Unicode WhiteSpace is a sequence of one or more Unicode whitespace characters.

A tab is U+009

A space is U+0020

An ASCII control character is between U+000-1F or U+007F
(both inclusive)

An ASCII punctuation character is !,", #, $, %, &, ', (, *, +, 
,,-, ., !, (U+0021-2F), :,;,<,=,>,?,@(U+003A-0040), [, \, ], _, `
(U+005B-0060), {, |, }, ~ (U+007B-007E)

A Unicode punctuation character is a character n the Unicode P (punctuation) or (synbol) general categories.

[I didnot understand the tabs and space thingy so just skip it for 
now.]

Insecure Characters
Replace U+0000 with U+FFFD (the replacement caracter)

Backslash escapes
Any ASCII punctuation character may be backslash-escaped.
backbefore any other chareacters are teated as literal backslasehs.
Escaped characters are treated as regular characters and do not 
have their usual Markdowon meanings.

If a backslash is itself escaped, the following characer is not.

A backslash at the end of the line is a hard line break.

backslash escapes donot work in code blocks, code spns, autolinks or raw HTML.




Lets try to understand delimiter run

A Delimiter Run is either a sequence of one or more "*" character that is not preceeded or followed by non backslash escaped "*" , or one or more "_" character that is not preceeded by or followd by non backslash escapred "_"

A Left Flanking Delimiter Run is a delimiter run that is not followed by unicode whitespace and (1) either not followed by unicode 
punctuation character and (2a) either not followed by unicode punctuation character or (2b) followed by unicode punctuation character and 
preceeded by unicode whitespace or unicode punctuation character. (For this definition beginning or a line is unicode whitespace and ending 
of a line is a unicode whitespace)
